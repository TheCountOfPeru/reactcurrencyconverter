# React Currency Converter
This is a single page React app for converting between currencies. It uses Tailwind CSS for the style and uses the https://freecurrencyapi.net/ api to get data about currency rates.

## Get Started

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Add the line `REACT_APP_KEY=` to the file. Create and account at https://freecurrencyapi.net/. Copy the api key given to you into the `REACT_APP_KEY=api here`. Run the command `npm start` to start the app in your browser. Your browser should open a page at `http://localhost:3000/`.
